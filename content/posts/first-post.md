## Welcome to my blog!

### First I would like to talk a little about the name of the Blog, Transcendental, what I mean for Transcendental Blog.

#### After going through the meanings of Transcendental in different dictionaries I would like to tell what is the meanings of the word Transcendental used in this blog:

- A transcendental experience, event, object, or idea that is extremely special and that cannot be understood in ordinary ways.
- exceeding usual limits : surpassing
- extending or lying beyond the limits of ordinary experience
- transcending the universe or material existence
- universally applicable or significant
- transcendent, surpassing, or superior. Â· being beyond ordinary or    
  common experience, thought, or belief.
- beyond our experience of phenomena, although not beyond potential 
  knowledge
- surpassing the natural plane of reality or knowledge
E.g. The soul is transcendental, it can not be seen but it can be perceived because when it is not present in a body, the body is called dead.

Of course I will also speak about things that are not "Transcendental", relate to our daily life...

Dear Srila Prabhupada,

 I am writing this 2023 Vyasa Puja offering to you from your house here in Vrindavana, the same house where you had your final pastimes to our mortal eyes. Correcting, it was not final at all because you are still displaying your pastimes on this planet, otherwise how can I, an insignificant and fallen kali yuga soul, be here in Vrindavana, one of the most sacred Dhamas and in your house? 
 I joined your ISKCON in Brazil, in 1985. Eight years after you “departed”, by the strength of your preaching in yours purports, in the Bhagavad-Gita As It Is. I became convinced that, here is the Truth, by your mercy. Many souls, even nowadays in 2023, still get enlightened by your preaching in your books, classes, room conversations, morning walks, etc.

 On this auspicious day of your 127th Vyasa Puja, I beg you to bless me so I can remain under the shelter of your teachings and in association of your disciples and followers.

 Your insignificant servant,

Yajna Murti das
